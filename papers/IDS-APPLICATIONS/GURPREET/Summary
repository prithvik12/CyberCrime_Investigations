Summary:
The paper titled "The Network Management Design Integrated with the Intrusion Detection System" presents a comprehensive design that combines Network Management System (NMS) and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) functionalities. The study aims to create an integrated system that leverages the strengths of both components to enhance network security, manageability, and performance.

The authors emphasize the critical role of network management in ensuring the reliable and efficient operation of modern computer networks. At the same time, the growing frequency and sophistication of network attacks necessitate effective intrusion detection mechanisms to safeguard network assets.

The proposed integrated design involves integrating the functionalities of NMS and IDS to create a collaborative system. The NMS component is responsible for monitoring and managing network performance, configuration, and resource allocation. On the other hand, the IDS component focuses on detecting and responding to potential security threats and intrusions.

By combining these two functionalities, the integrated system can provide a comprehensive view of the network's health and security posture. The NMS can collect data from various network devices and provide real-time insights into network performance and resource utilization.

Meanwhile, the IDS component continuously analyzes network traffic and data to detect anomalies and potential intrusion attempts. When suspicious activities are identified, the integrated system can trigger appropriate responses, such as generating alerts, blocking malicious traffic, or taking other security measures.

The paper discusses the benefits of this integrated approach, including improved incident response times and the ability to correlate security events with network performance data. The integrated system enables network administrators to proactively detect and respond to security incidents while efficiently managing network resources.

The authors also present the implementation and evaluation of the integrated system, considering factors such as detection accuracy, false positive rates, and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing network security and management.

In conclusion, the paper highlights the significance of integrating Network Management System and Intrusion Detection System functionalities to create a more robust and proactive approach to network security and performance management. The proposed integrated design offers valuable insights into the potential benefits of this collaborative approach.

Key Points:(The proposed integrated approach of network management and an intrusion detection system offers a cohesive solution to strengthen network security and management. By combining the capabilities of both systems, the integrated design provides network administrators with valuable insights into network behavior and potential security threats, enabling timely and effective responses to security incidents.
