Publication Year: 2014

Summary:
The paper titled "Integrating Intrusion Detection System with Network Monitoring" explores the integration of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with network monitoring to enhance the security of computer networks. The study aims to provide a comprehensive framework that combines the capabilities of both IDS and network monitoring tools to improve the detection and mitigation of security threats.

The authors first emphasize the importance of ensuring network security due to the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks. Traditional network monitoring tools are valuable in providing real-time insights into network traffic and performance but may not be sufficient to detect and respond to emerging security threats effectively.

To address this limitation, the paper proposes integrating IDS with existing network monitoring infrastructure. By doing so, the combined system can leverage the strengths of both components. Network monitoring tools continuously gather and analyze network traffic data, while the IDS component can identify patterns and anomalies indicative of potential intrusions or security breaches.

The integration process involves configuring the network monitoring tool to feed its data into the IDS for analysis. The IDS, in turn, applies various detection techniques such as signature-based detection, anomaly detection, or behavioral analysis to identify potential security incidents. When a suspicious activity is detected, the integrated system can trigger appropriate responses, such as generating alerts, blocking malicious traffic, or launching additional security measures.

By combining these two functionalities, organizations can enhance their ability to detect and respond to various types of security threats, including intrusions, malware, and unauthorized access attempts. The integrated approach provides a more comprehensive and proactive security posture, enabling network administrators to identify potential security incidents in real-time and take prompt action to mitigate risks.

Overall, the paper highlights the significance of integrating IDS with network monitoring tools as a valuable strategy to strengthen network security and protect against evolving cyber threats.
